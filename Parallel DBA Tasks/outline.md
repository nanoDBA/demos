### **Presentation Outline: Parallel DBA Tasks**

---

#### **1. Introduction**

   - **Opening Welcome**:
     - "Hey everybody, welcome to the last session of the this PowerShell Saturday NC!"
     - Thank you for being here - I congratulate you on investing in your careers with time and money to be here on a Saturday!
     - Thank you to our sponsors, including System Frontier, Chocolatey, Ironman Software, and TEKSystems
     - Introduce yourself:
       - "My name is Lars Rasmussen, and I've been passionate about PowerShell for a long time."

   - **Background and Personal Journey**:
     - **Early Excitement with PowerShell**:
       - "I started using PowerShell back when it was still in beta..."

     - **Role on the Operations Team**:
       - At that time, I was working on an Operations Team where we had to handle a lot of repetitive tasksâ€”daily, weekly, and monthly. These included signing off on tasks, performing routine checks, and more.
     - **Discovering Automation**:
       - "I quickly realized how PowerShell could help automate these repetitive tasks. Learning to use PowerShell to automate our workflows was not only efficient but also a lot of fun."  (Jeffrey Snover 2013 PowerShell 3.0 Jumpstart quote about making computing fun again needed)

   - **Excitement for PowerShell**:
     - "I loved the challenge of automating tasks using PowerShell, and it became a huge part of my toolkit. Today, I'm excited to share some of the ways it can help optimize workloads in databases."

   - **Topic Overview**:
     - "Tonight, we'll be discussing how you can optimize different database workloads using DBA tools."

#### **2. Overview of DBA Tools**

   - **What are DBA Tools?**:
     - Introduce the `dbatools` PowerShell module.
     - Explain that it's a community-driven module designed for SQL Server DBAs.
     - Highlight its primary use cases: automation, management, migration, and optimization of SQL Server environments.

   - **Why DBA Tools Matter for Database Optimization**:
     - Discuss the importance of automating repetitive and complex tasks.
     - Emphasize how DBA tools simplify managing multiple databases and servers.
     - Share statistics or examples of time saved using DBA tools.

#### **3. Workload Optimization Concepts**

   - **Serial Execution vs. Parallel Execution**:
     - **Define Serial Execution**:
       - Tasks are performed one after another.
       - Analogy: A two-lane highway with construction causing one-way traffic.
     - **Define Parallel Execution**:
       - Multiple tasks are executed simultaneously.
       - Analogy: A multi-lane freeway allowing continuous flow in both directions.
     - **Why It Matters**:
       - Highlight the efficiency gains in executing tasks in parallel, especially in large environments, and being able to prove you did it(auditing).

   - **Advantages of Parallel Execution**:
     - Reduced total execution time.
     - Better resource utilization across multiple servers.
     - Ability to scale operations a corresponding increase in time or effort.

#### **4. Demo: Using DBA Tools for Optimization**

   - **Setup for the Demo**:
     - Explain that you will create multiple SQL Server containers to simulate a multi-server environment.
     - Outline the tools and scripts you'll use (e.g., PowerShell scripts leveraging `PoshRSJob` and `dbatools`, and `ImportExcel` modules).

   - **Running Tasks at Scale with DBA Tools**:
     - **Leveraging Parallel Execution**:
       - Show how to use PowerShell runspaces or jobs to execute tasks in parallel.
       - Discuss the use of parameters like `-Parallel` in certain cmdlets.
     - **Example Scenarios**:
       - Comparing server configurations (CPU, memory, settings).
       - Performing bulk operations like backups or index maintenance.
       - Monitoring performance metrics across servers.

   - **Live Demonstration**:
     - Walk through a script that performs a task serially.
     - Modify the script to execute the same task in parallel.
     - Highlight the difference in execution time and efficiency.

#### **5. Interactive Demos and Adjusting the Approach**

   - **Flexibility in Execution**:
     - Acknowledge that live demos may not always go as planned.
     - Encourage an interactive approach where audience questions can steer the demo.
     - Be prepared to adjust the demonstration based on interest and questions.

   - **Q&A Session During the Demo**:
     - Invite participants to ask questions via chat.
     - Mention that co-hosts (Phil and Kevin) will moderate and relay questions.
     - Encourage a collaborative environment where learning is shared.

#### **6. Real-World Use Case Scenarios**

   - **Scenario 1: Addressing Gaps in Infrastructure as Code (IAC)**:
     - **Challenges with IAC**:
       - Even with IAC, some manual configurations are often missed.
       - Discuss common areas where IAC might fall short in database environments.
     - **Using DBA Tools to Fill the Gaps**:
       - Show how DBA tools can automate the manual tweaks not covered by IAC.
       - Examples: Setting server-level configurations, applying security settings.

   - **Scenario 2: Comparing and Synchronizing Configurations**:
     - **Need for Consistency**:
       - Importance of having consistent configurations across servers.
     - **Using `dbatools` Cmdlets**:
       - Demonstrate commands like `Get-DbaSpConfigure`, `Compare-DbaSpConfigure`.
       - Show how to generate reports or apply configurations to multiple servers.

#### **7. Common Questions**

   - **FAQ 1: Can You Use Parallel Execution with Only One Database?**
     - **Answer**:
       - Parallel execution is most beneficial when working with multiple databases or servers.
       - However, certain tasks within a single database can be parallelized if they are independent.
     - **Example**:
       - Running multiple independent queries simultaneously.

   - **FAQ 2: How to Monitor and Optimize Schedulers?**
     - **Understanding `MAXDOP`**:
       - Explain the Maximum Degree of Parallelism setting in SQL Server.
       - How it affects query execution plans and CPU usage.
     - **Using DBA Tools**:
       - Show how to check and set `MAXDOP` using `dbatools`.
       - Discuss best practices for configuring scheduler settings.

   - **FAQ 3: Handling Limitations and Errors in Parallel Execution**
     - **Potential Issues**:
       - Resource contention, deadlocks, and increased complexity.
     - **Mitigation Strategies**:
       - Monitoring resource utilization.
       - Gradually increasing the degree of parallelism.
       - Implementing error handling in scripts.

#### **8. Conclusion**

   - **Key Takeaways**:
     - Parallel execution significantly optimizes workload processing across multiple databases.
     - PowerShell and DBA tools are powerful allies in automating and streamlining DBA tasks.
     - Emphasize the importance of continually seeking ways to improve efficiency.

   - **Next Steps**:
     - Encourage attendees to:
       - Explore the `dbatools` module and its extensive documentation.
       - Experiment with parallel execution in a test environment.
       - Contribute to the `dbatools` community if possible.

   - **Final Q&A Session**:
     - Open the floor for any remaining questions.
     - Offer contact information or resources for further learning.
     - Thank the audience for their participation and engagement.
